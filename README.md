# noble-prize-search
A simple app I made to practice async fetching and frontend styling. You can search for nobel prize winners using one of: 
* Laureate last name,
* Laureate birth country, 
* Laureate birth city, 
* Nobel Prize category

This is obviously far from polished and could use things like: 
* deleting input resets the UL
* separate JS into a proper file
* use proper objects
* etc
* etc
